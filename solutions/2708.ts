/**
 * You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums representing the score of students in an exam. The teacher would like to form one non-empty group of students with maximal strength, where the strength of a group of students of indices i0, i1, i2, ... , ik is defined as nums[i0] * nums[i1] * nums[i2] * ... * nums[ikâ€‹].
 * 
 * Return the maximum strength of a group the teacher can create.

// Logic:
// * Exclude every student with score 0
// * All other students can contribute
// * Must have an even number of negative numbers, so:
//   * Keep track of the smallest negative number encountered so far
//   * At the end, if the total is negative, divide by the smallest negative number (which will hopefully be `-1` so as
//       to not affect the score, but that doesn't actually affect our logic. Might do for extension questions, though!)
//   * Also keep track of if any positive numbers have been encountered - to account for degenerate cases like `[0, -1]`
